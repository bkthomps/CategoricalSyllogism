 * Bailey Thompson <br>
 * Categorical Syllogism (1.0.3) <br>
 * 15 January 2016 <br>
 * <br>
 * Randomly generates a categorical syllogism and the three letters and one number which describes it.&nbsp;It also
 * states whether the syllogism is valid or invalid.&nbsp;As such, if a fallacy is committed, the fallacy will be red,
 * if the fallacy is not committed, it will be green.&nbsp;It is also possible to add words which will be randomly
 * generated in the statements.&nbsp;Last but not least, the program has a venn diagram.&nbsp;Check marks will appear as
 * green, x marks will appear as red, and filled in sections will be filled in with orange.
